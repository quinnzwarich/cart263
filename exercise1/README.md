# Project 1

This simulation generates a field of flowers using perlin noise.
The idea behind the interaction is that it becomes an unending game of
"loves me... loves me not..." that the user plays through uprooting flowers
(as opposed to delicately plucking pedals). In doing so, they also generate notes
from a minor pentatonic scale.
