# Do you Want to Keep Going?

Do you Want to Keep Going? is the culmination of many conflicting ideas that I wanted to pursue over the course of the semester. It tells the story of a student looking for a pencil and an eraser. Though it is a plain story, it deals with both my recollection of grade school and my experience of zoom education over the course of the past year. This is communicated through tension that is established between the events that are described and those which are visually depicted. You are told that you are surrounded by everything that signifies a learning environment such as your peers and the teacher writing on the blackboard, though in reality you are sitting in an empty room with light that occasionally perforates through it.
	It is in part an elaboration on my last project. I realized that I wanted to expand on its aesthetic and form though I also wanted its structure to be more predetermined and with a greater capacity for user interaction. There is still not as much as I’d like in the way of interactivity though it at least situates the user and gives them control over the pace of the story as well as the order in which it unfolds, even if they are unable to change its outcome.
I also wanted to experiment with using more assets in order to make use of the ease with which they are incorporated into Phaser’s workflow, that being in comparison to my experience of relying on assets with p5.js. I still used p5.js to process almost all of the images though I also made further use of Photoshop as well as Max MSP to make soundtrack pieces. I believe my focus on constructing and organizing assets is part of what allowed me to focus more on storytelling and less on solving technical problems, which have inundated me to a greater extent in my efforts to make visuals from scratch.

Both the image of the classroom and the image of the chairs I stole from google images..
I wasn't able to find the exact source of the chairs though the classroom image is apparently
a stock photo (I tried to process them both beyond recognition but I understand that this is maybe a faux-pas):
